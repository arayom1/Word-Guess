A Word Guess Game
(This Game Was Completed as Part of a School Project in 2019)

This application is a word-guess game where the player has a total of 10 chances to guess a hidden word correctly. For each game, the player attempts to guess the word within the allowed number of tries. If the player successfully guesses the word within the 10 attempts, the game is considered a win, and the win count is incremented. If the player fails to guess the word after 10 attempts, the game is considered a loss, and the loss count is incremented. The application keeps track of the total number of wins and losses across multiple rounds of play.

This is how the game looks:
